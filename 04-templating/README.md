# Templating Charts

TODO: add more info on chart templating here

## Adding the Back-End

Helm templates are written in a language called `gotemplate`. Along with the basic functions provided by the core language, Helm also provides dozens of extra functions from the [Sprig library](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig).

The best reference for Helm chart syntax, style, and techniques can be found in the official [Helm chart guide](https://docs.helm.sh/developing_charts/#charts).
